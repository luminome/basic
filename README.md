ABSTRACT

March 2020:
Sensing I would be spending the foreseeable future locked in the studio, 
I set out to apply myself to a ‘complete’ project. I wanted to hybridize all of the disciplines I'm familiar with: computer science, physics, engineering, mathematics, design, and art. My studio became a laboratory. After four months (June), I had a working printer. To make it more interesting, I worked until now to make it function autonomously; observing information and relaying it visually over time.

Conceptually, the system explores input and output (I/O) as being shared by both the human creative process and the digital/mechanical process. The creative mind is driven by imagination, interpretation, emotion, and reaction. In turn it applies those forces to some kind of material. Similarly, a system is driven by matching raw input to a corresponding action. Both respond programmatically —either directly or in a more nuanced way— to a set of inputs and subsequently relay their findings. 

The ‘input’ side of my creative process is informed by things that are really limited these days (e.g.: traveling or going outside). To accommodate that, I existed in a smaller scope; exploring ‘input/output’ in a synthetic and concrete way. ‘The system’ —a primitive analog— became a set of eyes, a set of information they look at, and a tiny mind full of its own rules used to interpret and convey what it sees.
